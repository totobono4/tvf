[0x00-0x01] - 2 bytes (16bits) - uint16 - video height
[0x02-0x03] - 2 bytes (16bits) - uint16 - video width

- CONTENT [0x04-0x??]
2 bytes (16 bits) - diff/rep
if < 0x8000 : diff
else : rep

diff - uint8
rep - uint8 (substract 0x8000)

1 byte (8bits) - uint8 - gray shade (repeat diff times if diff)
